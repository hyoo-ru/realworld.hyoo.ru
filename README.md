> ### $mol codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://nin-jin.github.com/conduit/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Issue](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/198)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with [**$mol**](https://github.com/eigenmethod/mol) including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **$mol** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
